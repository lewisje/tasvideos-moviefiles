This project is an organization repository for [TASVideos](http://tasvideos.org/) input movie files.

This project is not intended to replace TASVideos as a repository for all things TAS or emulator-related, nor is it intended to be a primary source for input movie files.

Version 1.02 of the input file batch (all movies up to and including movie 1694) is available for download. There are two archives, one ("moviefiles") which contains only non-obsoleted movie files and has game name first, and the other ("moviefilesall") which contains all movie files ever published and has TASVideos publication numbers first.
